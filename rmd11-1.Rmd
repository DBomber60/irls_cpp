Setup: We have a random graph of a given size (i.e., nodes = $n$) where each edge has equal probability of occuring (independent of all other edges). We want to formulate this in terms of a generalized linear model. That is, formulate a $G(n,p)$ random graph as a GLM. 

Design matrix: consists of the adjancency matrix with a an additional column of $1s$, for the intercept term. In the case where we have 4 nodes, 

$X=\left( \begin{matrix}
   1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
   1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
   1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
   1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0  \\
   1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
   1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1  \\
\end{matrix} \right)$

Response vector: ${{Y}_{6\text{x}1}}=1(e\in G)$

Model: $g(EY)=X\beta$ 

If our graph is $G(n=4,p={{p}_{0}})$, then $\beta ={{\left( \begin{matrix}
   {{g}^{-1}}({{p}_{0}}) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
\end{matrix} \right)}^{T}}$
